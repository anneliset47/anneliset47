# 👋 Hi, I’m Annelise Thorn.

💼 I'm a data scientist based in Raleigh, currently working in the bioinformatics industry.

👀 I’m interested in analysis and prediction related to product analytics and user experiences. My work typically focuses on A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive analytics, reporting & insights, and defining new metrics. The tools I primarily use are Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Adobe Analytics.

🌱 I recently worked on measuring user effort and friction and understanding how this impacts the bottom line of a business.

💞️ I enjoy building communities in analytics & tech. I'm an ambassador with Women in Data Science and help organize the annual WiDS Chicago conference.

📝 I share my thoughts on Medium, especially on how to break into the analytics field and how to network effectively. I also occasionally present at conferences.
